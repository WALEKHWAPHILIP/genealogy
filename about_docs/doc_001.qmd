# WalsoftAI-Genealogy: Ancestral Narrative Web App – Technical & Cultural Blueprint

## 1. Project Overview & Vision

### 🧭 Project Name
**WalsoftAI-Genealogy**  
*A culturally-rooted, AI-enhanced family history platform for the Luhya community and beyond.*

---

### 🎯 Vision Statement

The WalsoftAI-Genealogy platform is a scalable web application designed to preserve, narrate, and explore African family lineage — starting with the Luhya (Bakhabi) people of Busia, Kenya. It goes beyond visual trees by using AI to generate **natural language stories** from family data, helping current and future generations reconnect with their ancestral roots.

We aim to solve a pressing problem: as elders pass away, intergenerational knowledge — names, clans, family ties, and origin stories — is disappearing. This app ensures those stories are captured, structured, and beautifully retold.

---

### 🔍 Purpose

- Preserve African genealogy and oral history
- Provide younger generations with understandable family narratives
- Respect African marriage structures (polygamy, remarriage)
- Avoid assumptions based on Western lineage models
- Offer an AI-powered natural storytelling interface (free, local models)
- Scale from one family to an entire ethnic group’s genealogical system

---

### 🔑 Core Features (MVP Phase)

- Add/edit individuals (name, gender, clan, birth/death, location, biography)
- Track both **maternal and paternal** lineage
- Support **multiple marriages** (polygamy, divorce, remarriage)
- Visualize family tree structure
- Generate flowing **ancestral stories** using offline AI
- Prevent duplicate entries through smart matching
- Secure, permission-controlled editing

---

### 📦 What Makes It Different

- AI-generated **narratives**, not just data
- Rooted in **Luhya cultural structures** (e.g., subclans, totems, polygamy)
- Designed for **offline/local AI**, no reliance on paid APIs
- Built for **sustainability and collaboration** across generations



---

## 4. Data Modeling & Relationship Logic

At the heart of WalsoftAI-Genealogy is a flexible, culturally-aware data structure that can capture:
- Maternal and paternal ancestry
- Polygamous and sequential marriages
- Migration and origin history
- Free-form narrative content

---

### 🧬 Core Models

#### 1. `Person`
Represents each individual in the genealogy database.

```{python}
class Person(models.Model):
    full_name = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    first_name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    middle_name = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    surname = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    gender = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=[('male', 'Male'), ('female', 'Female')])
    date_of_birth = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    date_of_death = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    place_of_origin = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
    clan = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    subclan = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
    father = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='children_by_father')
    mother = models.ForeignKey('self', null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL, related_name='children_by_mother')
    biography = models.TextField(blank=True)
    photo = models.ImageField(upload_to='photos/', null=True, blank=True)
    created_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now_add=True)

```


#### 2. `Marriage`

Captures relationships including polygamy and remarriage.

```{python}
class Marriage(models.Model):
    partners = models.ManyToManyField(Person, related_name='marriages')
    date_of_marriage = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    end_date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
    reason_for_end = models.CharField(max_length=255, blank=True)
```

#### 3. `Event`

Captures additional facts like education, migration, or life events.

```{python}
class Event(models.Model):
    person = models.ForeignKey(Person, on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    event_type = models.CharField(max_length=100)  # e.g., 'education', 'migration'
    description = models.TextField()
    date = models.DateField(null=True, blank=True)
```

---

### 📐 Relationship Logic

* **Dual lineage** is supported via `father` and `mother` foreign keys.
* **Siblings** are inferred from shared parent(s).
* **Marriages** can involve more than two individuals (polygamy).
* Children are linked only to *individuals*, not to the `Marriage` object, to avoid rigid structures.

---

### 🚨 Deduplication and Validation

To avoid duplicate entries (e.g., “John Okiya” vs “John Meshak Okiya”):

* Use `fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz` to compute similarity
* Warn users during creation: "Possible duplicate: John Meshak Okiya (b. 1950, from Busia)"
* Allow aliases and nicknames

---

### 🔄 Versioning (Audit Trail)

* Use `django-simple-history` or `django-reversion`
* Every edit to a `Person` or `Marriage` is tracked
* Admins can restore or compare changes



---


## 5. AI Integration & Narrative Generation

### 🎯 Purpose

The WalsoftAI-Genealogy platform uses local, free AI models to transform structured family data into **natural, flowing stories**. These narratives go beyond technical lineage charts — they bring ancestors to life in culturally grounded prose that’s understandable and memorable.

---

### 🧠 Key Use Cases

1. **Generate Person-Based Narratives**

_Example_:  
“John Meshak Okiya was born to Peter and Alice in Busia. He was the third child in a family of 12. His father also had a second wife, Nancy...”

2. **Summarize Family Lineage**

_Example_:  
“Peter married Alice and Nancy. Alice bore five children and Nancy had seven. Together, they formed the extended household of Peter, whose own father, Dennis, was one of four siblings...”

3. **Answer Genealogical Questions**

_Examples_:  
- “Who is Philip?”  
- “Am I related to Joseph Wafula?”  
- “Is Anazio Walekhwa part of my family line?”

---

### 🧰 AI Tools and Technologies

#### 🛠 Model Runner: `llama-cpp-python`

- Runs local large language models (LLMs) directly on your server
- No internet or API required
- Supports `.gguf` quantized models for high performance
- Lightweight and production-safe

##### Installation:

```{bash}
pip install llama-cpp-python
````

##### Example Integration:

```{python}
from llama_cpp import Llama

llm = Llama(model_path="/models/phi3.gguf", n_ctx=2048)
prompt = render_template("person_story_prompt.jinja", context_data)
output = llm(prompt)["choices"][0]["text"]
```

---

### 🧠 Primary Model: **Phi-3 Mini**

| Feature    | Details                        |
| ---------- | ------------------------------ |
| Model Name | `Phi-3 Mini (gguf)`            |
| Size       | \~1.8GB                        |
| Speed      | Very fast on low-resource CPUs |
| Quality    | Excellent for short narratives |
| Hosting    | Self-hosted, local-only        |

Store models in:
`/home/philip/models/phi3-mini.gguf`

---

### 📋 Prompt Templating

Narrative prompts are built using **Jinja2**, drawing from the `Person`, `Marriage`, and `Event` models.

#### Example Prompt Template:

```{jinja2}
{{ person.full_name }} was born to {{ person.father.full_name }} and {{ person.mother.full_name }} in {{ person.place_of_origin }}.
He was the {{ person.birth_order }} child in a family of {{ person.siblings_count }}.
{{ person.father.full_name }} had {{ father_spouse_count }} spouses including {{ father_other_spouses }}.
{{ person.full_name }}'s grandfather, {{ paternal_grandfather }}, came from {{ paternal_origin }} and was known as a {{ ancestor_occupation }}.
```

---

### 🔁 Story Handling

* **On-demand story generation**: triggered via button or query
* **Stored summaries**: saved into a `Person.story` field after generation
* **Editable**: users can refine the AI-generated narrative if needed

---

### 🔎 Query Handling

All genealogical queries (e.g., “Am I related to X?”) are processed in two stages:

1. **Data Traversal**: use relationship logic (parent → grandparent, etc.) to find connection path
2. **Narrative Generation**: AI turns the results into readable explanations

---

### 🧠 Narrative Quality Checks

* All prompts include fallback handling (e.g., unknown parents)
* Generated text is post-processed to fix common AI grammar issues
* Stories are tied to structured data — updates will refresh stories when requested

---

### 🗃 Model Storage & Runtime

* Store models in `/home/philip/models/`
* Load models at boot or on-demand using `supervisor` or `systemd`
* LLM runs on localhost and exposes a function call or minimal API

---

### 🔐 Security and Privacy

* Stories are never sent to external APIs
* All AI runs locally to preserve family privacy
* Role-based access controls prevent unauthorized generation/editing



---

## 7. Data Integrity, Roles & Checks and Balances

In a collaborative, culturally sensitive genealogy platform, **data correctness, trust, and accountability** are critical. This section defines how WalsoftAI-Genealogy maintains clean, accurate, and respectful family data.

---

### 🧾 Key Risks We Must Prevent

| Risk | Description |
|------|-------------|
| ❌ Duplicate entries | Same person added with variations (e.g., “John Okiya” vs “Meshak John Okiya”) |
| ❌ Inconsistent lineage | Conflicting parent-child relationships |
| ❌ Unauthorized editing | Unverified users modifying sensitive ancestral records |
| ❌ Data loss or corruption | System errors or accidental deletions |
| ❌ Culturally inappropriate assumptions | Imposing Western rules (e.g., monogamy-only structures) |

---

### 🛡️ Strategies for Accuracy and Safety

#### ✅ 1. Smart Duplicate Detection
- Fuzzy matching using `fuzzywuzzy` on:
  - Full name variants
  - Nicknames / aliases
  - Place of origin + DOB range
- Prompts user during entry:  
  _“This person may already exist: Meshak Okiya, born in Busia. Do you want to review this record instead?”_

#### ✅ 2. Aliases & Spellings Support
- Store alternative names in a `Person.aliases` JSONField
- Capture tribal or religious name variations

#### ✅ 3. Structured Relationships
- Each person has explicit `mother` and `father`
- Children are inferred from reverse links
- Siblings are calculated dynamically (same parent(s))

#### ✅ 4. Polygamy & Sequential Marriage Support
- Multiple spouses linked via `Marriage` model
- Each `Marriage` has metadata (start/end date, reason)
- Children are not bound to a specific `Marriage`, but to parents directly

#### ✅ 5. Admin Merge Tool
- Admin dashboard suggests likely duplicates
- Option to “Merge A into B”, showing:
  - Field conflicts
  - Relationship overlaps
  - Confirm or override decision

#### ✅ 6. Edit History & Versioning
- Use `django-simple-history` to track all changes to:
  - Person
  - Marriage
  - Event
- Changes are logged with timestamp and user info
- Admins can view or restore previous versions

---

### 👥 Roles & Permissions

| Role | Capabilities |
|------|--------------|
| **Admin** | Full control: add/edit/delete/merge, approve users, generate stories |
| **Contributor** | Add/edit family members, submit corrections, cannot delete or merge |
| **Viewer** | Read-only access to trees and narratives |
| **Research Mode (future)** | External historians can browse de-identified data for cultural studies |

All roles are assigned via Django Admin or a custom user management panel.

---

### 🛡️ Security Controls

- Strong password policy
- CAPTCHA for public forms (if exposed)
- Two-step verification (future enhancement)
- Role-based view restrictions
- Auto-log out after idle period

---

### 🔁 Integrity Checks (Periodic)

| Check | Frequency | Method |
|-------|-----------|--------|
| Duplicate name/person | Weekly | Fuzzy match scan |
| Orphaned records (no parent) | Monthly | Query + admin prompt |
| Broken relationships | Daily | Validation rules on save |
| Stories missing or outdated | Monthly | Regenerate using updated templates |

---

### 🗂️ Backups & Recovery

- PostgreSQL backups run via `cron` daily
- Static/media folder zipped weekly
- AI model files backed up manually on change
- Backups stored in: `/home/philip/apps/backup/`
- Recovery process is documented in `README.md`
